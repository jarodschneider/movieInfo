# movieInfo
Part I of my final assignment in Computing for Engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology

Unlike all previous homework assignments, this project was left very open-ended, with the only requirement being
that I utilize APIs to do something with data from the web (see Project.pdf for the specific assignment). However,
for Part I, there was an additional requirement of pulling data from the OMDb API. Part II is open-ended.

**movieInfo** uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to return information about a movie. Or, optionally,
a brief summary including rough analysis

## Dependencies
* [OMDb API Access](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

See function help for details of how to use each function
